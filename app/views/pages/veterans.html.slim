          | We are excited to partner with 4th HOOAH WI to offer veterans
            a positive outlet to manage their mental health. If you are
            a veteran, we want to share our joy of trail running with you. We
            know first hand the many benefits of trail running and the effects it
            can have on one's mental health. This is why we want to find a way to
            get you out on the trails.

          | Whether you are a seasoned runner or ready to try something new,
            Bigger Than The Trail wants to offer you a free entry into a trail
            race. Trail running isn't just about the race, but more about the
            community and friendships built along the way. We want to get to know
            you and join you in your training by offering opportunities for group
            runs. Group runs allow you to challenge yourself, grow, and meet
            others all while finding joy in running.
