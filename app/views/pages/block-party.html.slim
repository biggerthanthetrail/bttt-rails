        | WHAT:
      p
        | The 2020 BTTT Block Party is a virtual event for everyone. We have
          distances from 1 mile to 100 miles. All done from stepping out your
          front door and using your block to create your unique course.
      h2.headline
        | WHY:
      p
        | May is mental health month, and now more than ever, we need to let
          people know that mental health matters. What better way to do so than
          by running to let people know you care? Even though we can't be
          together physically by registering for this event, you are making
          a clear statement that mental health matters. Registration is $20 and
          is a tax-deductible donation that will 100% go to provide online
          counseling to those who need it most.
      h2.headline
        | WHEN:
      p
        | May 16, 2020, 8 am CST will be the official kick off. But you can
          share your experience anytime by using the hashtag #btttblockparty,
          #wearebttt, and #keepshining2020. The 2020 BTTT Block Party may be
          a running event, but more importantly, this is a fight against the
          stigma of mental health.

          mean you need to do it alone. We will be doing everything in our power
          to stay connected with all of you to make this experience
          unforgettable. We've partnered with the following companies to help us
