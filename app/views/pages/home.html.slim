          | Bigger Than The Trail is a 501(c)(3) tax exempt organization that is
            using trail running as a platform to advocate for mental health. Our
            mission is to enrich the lives of individuals struggling with
            mental health.
        p
          | We will achieve this mission by coming alongside
            individuals and providing educational support and treatment options.
            Please don't think our mission is limited to just people who run.
            This is much bigger than that. Running is not the focus; but rather the
            people we can impact. Our focus is to bring light to the real
            struggles and challenges that are associated with mental health.
        p
          | Mental health is something we can all advocate for using many different
            platforms. So please donâ€™t think you need to be a trail runner to help us
            advocate. Instead, we ask that you partner with us using your own passions as
            a platform to make our mission part of your life.
